            <div id="main-head-text">The UEFA Champions League (abbreviated as UCL, or sometimes, UEFA CL) is an annual club football competition organised by the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) and contested by top-division European clubs, deciding the competition winners through a round robin group stage to qualify for a double-legged knockout format, and a single leg final. It is one of the most prestigious football tournaments in the world and the most prestigious club competition in European football, played by the national league champions (and, for some nations, one or more runners-up) of their national associations.</div>

                <p>Real Madrid defeated Liverpool 1–0 in the final, which was played at the Stade de France in Saint-Denis, France, for a record-extending 14th title, and their fifth in nine years.[2] It was originally scheduled to be played at the Allianz Arena in Munich, Germany.[3] However, due to the postponement and relocation of the 2020 final, the final hosts were shifted back a year, with Saint Petersburg scheduled to host the 2022 final.[4] Due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the final was eventually moved to Saint-Denis.[3] As the winners, Real Madrid automatically qualified for the 2022–23 UEFA Champions League group stage, and also earned the right to play against the winners of the 2021–22 UEFA Europa League, Eintracht Frankfurt, in the 2022 UEFA Super Cup. Additionally, the winners typically qualify for the annual FIFA Club World Cup. However, the tournament's status remains uncertain, following FIFA's proposal for a format overhaul.[5] Chelsea were the defending champions, but were eliminated in the quarter-finals by eventual winners Real Madrid.</p>  </div>
